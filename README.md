# Predict_Age_of_Abalone

###### Problem - Predict the age of abalone using physical measurement features.
The age of an abalone is determined by counting the no. of rings.

###### Dataset Information:
There are 4177 rows and 9 attributes for each row of the dataset. They are:

Sex(nominal) - M (male), F (female), I (infant)

Length(continuous) - longest shell measurement (in mm)

Diameter(continuous) - measurement perpendicular to legnth (in mm)

Height(continuous) - with meat in shell (in mm)

Whole weight(continuous) - the whole abalone (in grams)

Shucked weight(continuous) - weight of the meat (in grams)

Viscera weight(continuous) - gut weight after bleeding (in grams)

Shell weight(continuous) - after being dried (in grams)

Rings(continuous) - gives the age in years

###### Solution
Create a model which will predict the age of an abalone from physical measu
